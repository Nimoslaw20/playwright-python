To create a virtual environment on a Mac and install Python Playwright, follow these steps in your terminal:

---

### ✅ **1. Open Terminal**

---

### ✅ **2. Navigate to your project directory**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

---

### ✅ **3. Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

This creates a folder named `venv` containing your virtual environment.

---

### ✅ **4. Activate the virtual environment**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` appear in your terminal prompt.

---

### ✅ **5. Upgrade pip (recommended)**

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

### ✅ **6. Install Playwright**

```bash
pip install playwright
```

---

### ✅ **7. Install Playwright browser binaries**

```bash
playwright install
```

This will download Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit needed to run tests.

---

### ✅ **8. (Optional) Save dependencies**

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

### ✅ **9. Run a basic test (optional)**

Create a file `test_script.py`:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    print(page.title())
    browser.close()
```

Then run it:

```bash
python tests/app.py

python -m tests.app  

use this now: python -m pytest tests/ -v --alluredir=allure-results
```

---

Let me know if you'd like to set up Pytest or run Playwright tests in headless mode.
